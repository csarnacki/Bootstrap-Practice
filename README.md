# Bootstrap-Practice

This file contains practice code for Bootstrap 4.

It includes code for creating all sorts of content using Bootstrap such as tables, images, progress bars, badges, buttons, pagination, font color, alerts and navigation bars.

Overall, it shows a wide variety of Bootstrap's capabilites and what I feel comfortable with when it comes to styling a page or website with it. Since this is just a practice page for me to gain more experience, there is no plans for updating it other than to continue experimenting with other Bootstrap features.
